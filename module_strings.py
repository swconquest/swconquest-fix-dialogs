 You can press the Tab key at any time to return to the tutorial menu."),

  ("tutorial_3_msg_1","This tutorial is intended to give you an overview of parrying and defence without a shield.\
 Parrying attacks with your weapon is a little bit more difficult than blocking them with a shield.\
 When you are defending with a weapon, you are only protected from one direction, the direction in which your weapon is set.\
 If you are blocking upwards, you will parry any overhead swings coming against you, but you will not stop thrusts or attacks to your sides.\
 Either of these attacks would still be able to hit you.\
 That's why, in order to survive without a shield, you must learn directional defence.\
 Go pick up up the quarterstaff now to begin practice."),
  ("tutorial_3_msg_2","By default, the direction in which you defend (by clicking and holding your right mouse button) is determined by the attack direction of your closest opponent.\
 For example, if your opponent is readying a thrust attack, pressing and holding the right mouse button will parry thrust attacks, but not side or overhead attacks.\
 You must watch your opponent carefully and only initiate your parry AFTER the enemy starts to attack.\
 If you start BEFORE he readies an attack, you may parry the wrong way altogether!\
 Now it's time for you to move on to the next room, where you'll have to defend yourself against an armed opponent.\
 Your task is to defend yourself successfully for thirty seconds with no equipment other than a simple staff.\

 Move on to the next room when you are ready to initiate the fight."),

  ("tutorial_4_msg_4","Draw your weapon (using the mouse wheel) and destroy the four targets.\

  ("npc5_backstory_a", "I am a gladiator, recently retired, having amassed a respectable 324-62 record in the pits of Gamorr.  Now I am seeing the galaxy I entertained for so long.  I travel from star system to star system, telling of my exploits and watching fights without the pressure of knowing that I will have to go against the winner.  It really is quite relaxing."),
  ("npc6_backstory_a", "My story? I'm a Corellian through and through.  I joined up with CorSec like my daddy before me.  My first raid, on a spice smuggling ring, went bad fast.  I took a stunner to the chest, and when I came to I was stashed with a bunch of my dead mates in a holding room."),

Or if not, then you have heard my many swoop-racing triumphs, and have seen all competitors humiliated by my speed and my reflexes!  Or perhaps you are one of the millions to have lost your love's true affections once she gazed upon an image of my perfect face."),
  ("npc10_backstory_a", "Ahaha. Not often you'll see a captain who sees this galaxy the right way. So many just say, 'oh, I hope for peace.' Peace isn't the reason for this universe, any more than repairs are the reason we have ships. We exist to fight, and peace is only good for preparing ourselves for the next day's struggle!"),
  ("npc11_backstory_a", "I'm proof you're wrong. Sure, the Republic banned it, and the Empire doesn't allow it either. But the Empire doesn't hold the whole galaxy, and the sad little secret is that in a great number of its planets, the Galactic Empire stops where the spaceport ends. This galaxy is run by crime lords, with a thin coat of Imperial grey to pretty it up for the rich."),

After all, who's got time to visit every single planet to prove you wrong?  Heck, for all I know drop bears really do exist somewhere, and this spray can of water really does repel 'em.  It's not a lie if it might be true, eh?"),

#backstory main body
  ("npc1_backstory_b", "Maybe a hundred years ago, we'd have been classmates on Coruscant.  But the galaxy's a different place now, and there are different rules.  There's no good guys; there's just guys who'll shoot you and guys who'll pay you to shoot other guys.  I came to realize that's the galaxy I live in."),
  ("npc2_backstory_b", "I was a Jedi and a general of the Republic during the Clone Wars.  I fought the Empire tooth and nail, but soon I realized I was in too deep.  I went into hiding, and I've done a good job of it for a long time.  But you made me realize I can't hide much longer."),
  ("npc3_backstory_b", "I am a Jedi!  Well, I'm not really a Jedi.  In fact, I'm not entirely sure if I am anything of the sort at all.  But I do know that if I concentrate very hard on something, I think I can make it move.  I've spent a whole year practicing very hard."),
  ("npc4_backstory_b", "I joined the Empire like any good pilot.  234th TIE wing, designation DN-32-J.  Turns out, though, they just wanted to stick me in a backwater somewhere and make me fly boring non-stop patrols, scanning space dust hour and hour.  So I skipped out on my first R&R furlough, and went looking for a ticket back to the real action."),
  ("npc5_backstory_b", "Yes, I had been a gladiator until recently.  But recently, a man entered a cantina on the other side of the spaceport, and claimed he could fight and beat anyone.  I informed him, politely but firmly, that he was mistaken.  He swung his fist at me.  I punched him sharply in the chest, and he fell dead, his heart stopped cold. I am sure it was no murder, for I acted in self-defense.  However, the man was the son of the local security chief."),
  ("npc6_backstory_b", "After my capture, I saw opportunity.  I dumped my uniform, swapped clothes and ID with a dead smuggler, filled my pack with glitterstim, and set off.  That spice bought a pretty penny, and I've been drinking, gambling, and brawling across the galaxy ever since."),
  ("npc7_backstory_b", "I am Jade Codi, wife of Sothan Codi, Senator from Fondor.  Well, he was the Senator from Fondor, way back when.  I thought political life and old rivalries were behind us, but apparently an old unsettled score with a local crime lord finally caught up with us.  Sothan's dead now, and so I went into hiding."),
  ("npc8_backstory_b", "I spent two entire years trying to be a bounty hunter.  But yet I have not caught a single bounty.  Oh, it's not a matter of shooting, and it's not a matter of chasing.  I'm good at both.  I simply can't remember a face, captain.  Or much anything else, to be frank.  I can't tell a Sullustan from a Toydarian.  I once accidentally tried to turn my own aunt in for a bounty on Princess Leia of Alderaan.  But forgetting to bring my blaster to my attempt to capture you?  That's the last straw."),
  ("npc9_backstory_b", "I am the son of Vanam Xen, of the Xen Power-Core empire.  I didn't care much for the corporate life, so I spent my days as a swoop-racer, chasing fast fortunes and faster women. The swoopers called me a phony, sure, but they sure couldn't argue with my heat times. But then one day my parents disowned me, just because I slept with the wife of a business client. A couple bad bets and bad breaks on the track, and I ended up in the cantinas, with hardly a credit to my name."),
  ("npc10_backstory_b", "I'm a Mandalorian of the old line. I've fought in a hundred battles for a dozen sides. I've seen enough combat to know that's what we're here for. Politics, empires, rebellions, republics, planets, what have you. It's all the big dejarik board. The whole board is only there for that glorious moment when one piece strikes another. I've been around and everyone's told me they're fighting for peace. Well, I decided I won't fight for anyone who fights for peace."),
  ("npc11_backstory_b", "I was born a slave, daughter of a slave. When I was born, my duties were to be a playmate of my master's son.  When I was eight, my duties were to follow the boy, clean up for him, little things like that. When I became a young woman, well...I'm sure you understand. At twenty he sold me, and for the next twenty-five years I was a bound assistant to a sick, cruel man who called himself a doctor. But believe me, I am a slave no longer."),
  ("npc12_backstory_b", "I'm a nerf herder. Have been all my life.  Now I can already see the smile on your face, so drop it. If it weren't for us, your belly would be a lot leaner, and your crew a lot hungrier.  Anyways, I decided there was probably a galaxy beyond the fur and stink, so I sold my whole herd to buy transport offworld and to the nearest major spaceport."),
  ("npc13_backstory_b", "I'm a merchant by trade. I deal in the things that people only think they need. There are people out there who think they need to be prepared for every possible threat. So I make up a threat and then the cure. The way I look at it, a toy whistle I sell as a Drux Lizard call probably calls something somewhere, so it's not a complete lie. Unfortunately, I picked up a trail of angry customers who don't agree with me on that."),
  ("npc14_backstory_b", "I am a mercenary by trade, much as yourself, no doubt. And I have learned that the more you sweat your men, the more blood you'll save them and the more tears you'll save their wives. Unfortunately, the last captain I served as lieutenant to didn't see things quite the same way. I'm sure he regretted that when his men broke under pressure, tried to flee, and ended up taking Imperial blaster bolts to the back. Regret doesn't bring a man back, though, and I swore I'd never work for a soft captain again."),
  ("npc15_backstory_b", "I was a Jedi initiate once, back in the old days. I wasn't much for feeling the living Force, but I had a head for names, dates, and figures. A Jedi librarian, they made me, and I was a happy one. I focused my studies on architecture, a fascinating field, and became a good architect in my own right. After the Purge, I was able to leave the order and put my skills to use. Only now there's not much call for building; everyone just wants to tear things down. Well, I can do that too."),
  ("npc16_backstory_b", "I'm a hunter. A damn good hunter. Probably the best you'll see. I'm Echani, or at least half-Echani.  Can't speak for my father, I'm sure you know how it is.  But I can slip a vibroknife through whatever defenses you think you can offer. Darkness, seclusion, durasteel, blasters, lightsabers, whatever.  There's always a weak spot in their armor; there's always a sound in the shadows; there's always hole in their form."),

  ("npc3_backstory_c", "See, look at your glass...Well, it didn't work that time, but I promise I've done it many times before!  I'm sure I just need to get off this world and get some experience, and I'll be a great Jedi yet!"),

  ("npc7_backstory_c", "I need a ride off this planet and soon.  I've got a politician's tongue; I can get you the best deals for whatever your freighter is hauling.  I'll more than pay for my bunk."),
  ("npc8_backstory_c", "Look, I know I just tried to arrest you, but please, I'm not cut out for this work, captain.  And the Hutts have dropped thousands on my training and expenses, and I owe them a bounty or I'll owe them my head."),
  ("npc9_backstory_c", "Ring any bells?  Now unless you're here to buy holovid rights for a documentary on my engaging tragedy, or here to sponsor me for a race, leave me be."),
  ("npc10_backstory_c", "I'm not interested in the Imperials telling me they're fighting for order, or the Rebels saying they're fighting for liberty, or even the Hutts saying they're fighting for a buck. I'm interested in a captain who will fight the good fight for its own sake."),
  ("npc11_backstory_c", "He was a cruel man indeed; he treated those poor people who could afford no better, and...and he ordered me to mistreat patients so they would die and he could do...things...to them. I'll spare you the particulars, but my master is now deservedly dead and I am certain I will be hunted for it once they piece the bits of him back together."),
  ("npc12_backstory_c", "I'm looking to see the galaxy. I don't suppose you could give me a job on your crew?"),
  ("npc13_backstory_c", "Bring me aboard, friend, and I guarantee I'll repay you twenty times over. Sucker born every nanosecond in this galaxy, and if I could only get to other planets I'd get to sell to more of 'em."),
  ("npc14_backstory_c", "So, if you know of any captain who believes that the best way to protect his soldiers is to grind out the cowards and fools from their ranks, do let me know."),
  ("npc15_backstory_c", "I'm just looking for a steady income. If you need something built, I'll build it better and quicker than anyone else. If you need something brought down, well, that's not as rewarding, but I can do that too."),

I have been hunting among the Nords here, to see if I could find enough men to take back my husband's hall. But I could not find enough men to crew a longship, and those whom I gathered quickly got bored and wandered off -- not, I will add, before they drank away such gold as I had accumulated.

All over the Galaxy, men sing your praises. I have tried serving in other lords' armies, and believe me, what I have seen of them restores my opinion of your leadership. If you would have me in your company, I would fight for you again."),
  ("npc15_rehire_speech", "Why hello, {playername}. I can't say I'm entirely displeased to see you. You see, I took on another contract before I left, and sure enough, when it came time to collect the pay, the lord had nothing but talk and excuses and petty little complaints about my handiwork. I can't say I was always happy in your company, but at least I put gold directly into my purse after every battle. You still offering work?"),

I'll come out and admit that I cursed your name when we parted ways, but thinking back on it you weren't all that bad. All these lords, they're glad enough to send me on little side errands, but they don't much care to have me in their main battle-line. Apparently I spook the men. I've heard it muttered that I'm a witch, or that I eat men's hearts after killing them, or other rot. Not that I mind stabbing a man while he's asleep, but it's a lot more gratifying when he's awake and kicking. So I thought I'd try to find you again, see if you'll take me on."),

  ("npc16_home_description", "I once got hired to hunt a fishhead in Coruscant. That might not sound particularly hard, sure. But before I could get a plan together, he'd hopped a freighter headed back home to this big puddle. Now I do not let prey escape me, captain. I acquired access to a military transport, and I was in Mon Cal before he was. I didn't want him to get in the water, you see, because first there's no shadows or corners to hide me, and second I'm not built for water and fishheads are."),

  ("npc2_home_description_2", "Most Jedi learned of the Purge when they got a clone's blaster bolt in their back.  But my real, Mandalore-born soldiers stayed loyal to me.  I may not like war, but I can tell you that when it comes, the men and women from that planet are as trustworthy as any you will ever meet."),

  ("npc4_home_description_2", "By the time I reached the big rock, they were sitting dead on my tail, raking me with fire. All the blown-off bits of scrap metal must have been playing hell with their sensors, though, or maybe they just weren't paying attention to anything but their laser tracking, because when I scraped the armored belly of my ship against that rock, I slowed down right quick...and they didn't. One plowed into my stern, the other veered off at the last second, but lost control and slammed into an asteroid. My freighter was in a bad state, but better than if she was in the hands of pirates."),
  ("npc5_home_description_2", "Fighting isn't something they do for fun, or for honor.  They fight, because that's what Tatooine is. It's a fight, a fight for survival. Everyone there is a veteran of every day they live. I'd put a Tatooine farm boy up against a Gamorrean champion any day. Hell, I'd have spent my whole career in the pits there, if it weren't for the fact that nobody on that sandy rock has two credits to their name."),
  ("npc6_home_description_2", "Corellians are a proud people, with a strong sense of duty. Honorable service is rewarded well, and dereliction of duty...well...let's just say I'll stay on the ship, and that's that."),
  ("npc7_home_description_2", "As for me?  As a young girl, I left to go to Coruscant to study, and there I met my Sothan.  He was just a attendant to the Representative from Fondor then, but I could see the spark of greatness in his eyes...ah, but that was a different time."),
  ("npc8_home_description_2", "I should have known there I wasn't cut out for bounty hunting, but I wasn't about to give up on the family trade so soon. My mum is the best bounty hunter in the Duro system, and I planned on following her. I've got her eye, all right, but it turns out I've got the brains of my dad.  We're not dumb, mind you, but specifics and particulars don't stay in there quite so long as they do with other folk."),
  ("npc9_home_description_2", "Well, let me tell you, it will be mine. Once we're done campaigning together, I'll take what I've learned and what I've earned and raise up a little army of my own. Won't the fat board members be surprised when I burst into one of their little meetings, and dictate terms of my full and complete takeover!"),
  ("npc10_home_description_2", "The first one to come was their war-mother, dressed in paints and shrieking fiercely. Her beast reared back and roared, as she threw a thermal detonator right down at my fireteam. I still don't know how I did it, but I drew a bead and fired clean into her grenade with my pistol. That knocked it back as it detonated, right into the rancor's gullet. That moment, the flash when the bolt hit the detonator, captain, that's why we fight. That's why we live."),
  ("npc11_home_description_2", "I suppose it wasn't a great life I had at Kessel, but it wasn't terrible. I was sheltered from the bitter darkness of the mines, and from the hands of pirates. I was safe and had a warm bed, and my duties were mostly easy and sometimes enjoyable. I did not resent him as you might think I would. While I would rather live a day as a free woman than a century as a slave, for a girl born into slavery, my lot was the best I could have hoped for."),
  ("npc12_home_description_2", "But everybody thinks Kashyyyk is nothing but Wookiees, just because that's the way most of it is. Well, as any nerf-herder knows, if you just trust what most people think about most of something, and assume that mean all of that something is that way, then you've shut off your brains, and frankly, you're even dumber than a nerf.  That's what I think, anyway."),
  ("npc13_home_description_2", "Don't worry, though, captain.  We're not at any risk or anything.  I'm sure that it's completely harmless. But...just do be safe, okay?  I promise I'll remove it as soon as we land next, and put everything right again."),
  ("npc14_home_description_2", "Harsh climates like those, they send the cowards and weaklings who have no business anywhere near an army running back for the safety of home. If you ever find yourself needing to turn a rabble into an army, then that windswept rock of ice and snow is the best place I can think of."),
  ("npc15_home_description_2", "It's well worth a visit if you have an interest in architecture, captain. I've not found a more interesting city in the galaxy."),

I tracked it down, and making like I accidentally bumped into the tot, I affixed a very small, poisoned needle to its forehead. Imperceptible, but very sharp. One paternal hug later, the job was done. It was beautiful, captain, and I don't like to praise my own work."),

  ("swadian_rebellion_pretender_story_1",  "I was the only child of my father, King Esterich. Although I am a woman, he loved me like a son and named me his heir -- not once, but several times, before the grandest nobles of the land so that none could doubt his intention. There is no law that bars a woman from ruling -- indeed, we Swadians tell tales of warrior queens who ruled us in our distant past."),
  ("vaegir_rebellion_pretender_story_1",   "My father died when I was young, leaving me in the care of his brother, the regent Burelek. But rather than hold the throne until I came of age, this usurper used his newfound power to accuse my mother of adultery, and to claim that I was not my father's son. She was executed for treason, and I was declared a bastard."),
  ("khergit_rebellion_pretender_story_1",  "Sanjar Khan and I are brothers, sons of the old Janakir Khan, although of different mothers. Although I was the younger brother, all those who knew the old Khan will testify that throughout my father's life, I was his favorite, entrusted with the responsibilities of government. Sanjar busied himself with hunts and feasts to win the affection of the more dissolate of my father's commanders."),
  ("nord_rebellion_pretender_story_1",     "I am called the Far-Seeker because I have travelled great distances, even by the standards of the Nords, in search of knowledge. Before I came of age, my father sent me abroad on a tour of study at the courts and universities in the lands overseas. If the Nords are to call themselves the heirs of the Calradian empire, then they must act the part, and know something of law and letters, and not call themselves content merely to fight, plunder, and drink."),
  ("rhodok_rebellion_pretender_story_1",   "The Rhodoks are a free people, and not slaves to any hereditary monarch. The king must be chosen from one of the leading noble families of the land, by a council drawn by lot from the patricians of the cities of Jelkala, Veluca, and Yalen. The council meets on a field before Jelkala, and no man is allowed to appear in arms during their deliberations, on pain of death."),

  ("swadian_rebellion_pretender_story_2",  "Yet when my father died, his cousin Harlaus convinced the nobles that no Swadian king of sound mind could name a woman as his heir. Harlaus said that his designation of me was the act of a madman, and thus had no legal standing, and that he, as my father's closest male relative, should of take the throne."),
  ("vaegir_rebellion_pretender_story_2",   "I was smuggled abroad by a faithful servant, but now I am of age and have returned to reclaim what is rightfully mine. Burelek died soon after his act of perfidy -- the judgment of heaven, no doubt. His son Yaroglek now calls himself king, but as his claim is tainted, he is no less a usurper than his father, and I will topple him from his throne."),
  ("khergit_rebellion_pretender_story_2",  "According to Khergit custom, when a man dies his herds are split between all his sons, equally. So too it is with the khanate. When I heard of my father's death, I was away inspecting our borders, but I hurried home to Tulga, ready to give Sanjar his due and share the khanate with him. But when I arrived, I found that he rushed his supporters to the court, to have himself proclaimed as the sole khan."),
  ("nord_rebellion_pretender_story_2",     "My father died however before I completed my course of study, and as I hurried home to claim his throne my ship was wrecked by a storm. One of my father's thanes, Ragnar, seized this opportunity and spread rumors that I had died abroad. He summoned a gathering of his supporters to have himself proclaimed king, and has taken the past few years to consolidate his power."),
  ("rhodok_rebellion_pretender_story_2",   "During the last selection, there were but two candidates, myself, and Lord Graveth. While the council was deliberating, Graveth appeared, sword in hand, telling them that a Swadian raiding party was about to descend on the field of deliberation -- which was true, by the way -- and if he were not elected king, then he would leave them to their fate."),

  ("swadian_rebellion_pretender_story_3",  "I will admit that I did my cause no good by cursing Harlaus and all who listened to him as traitors, but I also believe that the magistrates who ruled in his favor were bought. No matter -- I will raise an army of loyal subjects, who would honour their old king's memory and will. And if anyone doubts that a woman can wield power, then I will prove them wrong by taking Harlaus' ill-gotten crown away from him."),

  ("khergit_rebellion_pretender_story_3",  "My brother thinks that Khergits will only respect strength: a leader who takes what he wants, when he wants it. But I think that he misreads the spirit of our people.--we admire a resolute leader, but even more we a just one, and we know that a man who does not respect his own brother's rights will not respect the rights of his followers."),
  ("nord_rebellion_pretender_story_3",     "So I remain in exile -- except now I am not looking for sages to tutor me in the wisdom of faraway lands, but warriors, to come with me back to the land of the Nords and regain my throne. If Ragnar doubts my ability to rule, then let him say so face to face, as we stare at each other over the rims of our shields. For a warrior can be a scholar, and a scholar a warrior, and to my mind, only one who combines the two is fit to be king!"),
  ("rhodok_rebellion_pretender_story_3",   "Well, Graveth defeated the Swadians, and for that, as a Rhodok, I am grateful. When I am king, I will myself place the wreath of victory on his head. But after that I will have it separated from his shoulders, for by his actions he has shown himself a traitor to the Rhodok confederacy and its sacred custom."),

  ("swadian_rebellion_monarch_response_1", "Isolla thinks she should be Queen of the Swadians? Well, King Esterich had a kind heart, and doted on his daughter, but a good-hearted king who doesn't use his head can be a curse to his people. Isolla may tell you stories of warrior queens of old, but you might also recall that all the old legends end in the same way -- with the Swadians crushed underfoot by the armies of the Calradic Emperor."),
  ("vaegir_rebellion_monarch_response_1",  "Were Valdym to come to me in peace, I would laden him with titles and honours, and he would become the greatest of my commanders. But as he comes in war, I will drag him before me in chains and make him acknowledge me as rightful sovereign, then cut his tongue from his mouth so that he cannot recant."),
  ("khergit_rebellion_monarch_response_1", "My brother Dustum has perhaps told you of his insistence upon splitting the khanate, as though it were a herd of sheep. Let me tell you something. Ever since the Khergits established themselves on this land, the death of every khan has had the same result -- the land was divided, the khan's sons went to war, and the strongest took it all anyway. I simply had the foresight to stave off the civil war in advance."),
  ("nord_rebellion_monarch_response_1",    "Lethwin 'Far-Seeker'? Lethwin Inkfingers, is more like it. Perhaps you have heard the expression, 'Unhappy is the land whose king is a child.' Unhappy too is the land whose king is a student. You want the Nords to be ruled by a beardless youth, whose hand bears no callouses left by a sword's grip, who has never stood in a shield wall? If Lethwin were king, his thanes would laugh at him to his face!"),
  ("rhodok_rebellion_monarch_response_1",  "No doubt Lord Kastor told you that I defiled the hallowed Rhodok custom by interfering with the patricians' election of a king. Well, let me tell you something. The patricians of the planet make longwinded speeches about our ancient liberties, but then choose as their king whichever noble last sat in their villa and sipped a fine wine and promised to overlook their unpaid taxes."),

  ("swadian_rebellion_monarch_response_2", "Those who weep for the plight of a Swadian princess denied her father's throne should reflect instead on the fate of a Swadian herdswoman seized by a Vaegir raider and taken as chattel to the slave markets. Talk to me of queens and old stories when our warlike neighbors are vanquished, and our land is at peace."),
  ("vaegir_rebellion_monarch_response_2",  "Whatever my father may or may not have done to secure the throne does not matter. I have inherited it, and that is final. If every old claim were to be brought up anew, if every man's inheritance could be called into question at any time, then it would be the end of the institution of kingship, and we would live in a state of constant civil war."),
  ("khergit_rebellion_monarch_response_2", "Dustum would make a fine assessor of flocks, or adjudicator of land disputes. But can you imagine such a man as khan? We would be run off of our land in no time by our neighbors, and return to our old days of starving and freezing on the steppe."),
  ("nord_rebellion_monarch_response_2",    "Old Hakrim may have had fancy ideas about how to dispose of his faction, but it is not just royal blood that makes a King of the Nords. I am king by acclamation of the thanes, and by right of being the strongest. That counts for more than blood, and woe to any man in this land who says otherwise."),
  ("rhodok_rebellion_monarch_response_2",  "The only liberty that concerns them is their liberty to grow fat. Meanwhile, my men sleep out on the steppe, and eat dry bread and salt fish, and scan the horizon for burning villages, and shed our blood to keep the caravan routes open. Here's an idea -- if I ever meet a merchant who limps from a Khergit arrow-wound or a Swadian sword-stroke, then I'll say, 'Here's a man whose counsel is worth taking.'"),
